# Programs_and_Daily_Challenges

These are some selected programs and daily challenges that I did according to course instructions and specifications. They're all written in C. In my evaluation some of them are inefficient or done in harder ways than necessary because they had to be written to satisfy some very specific instructions and they had to pass many unknown (to me) test checks. They were all done a while ago but will be uploaded here slowly and non-comprehensively over time.
